# Heresy and occupation in Bologna around 1300

This interactive map shows the locations of residence of people suspected of heresy in the register of Bologna, 1291–1310. It shows the distribution of suspects in space, including their sociodemographic characteristics (sex, type of occupation), religious affiliation (Cathar milieu, Apostolic milieu, and other heterodoxy), as well as position in the trial (deponents vs. non-deponents). Any of these characteristics can be used to filter the set of persons shown.

We included all individuals who were incriminated, either by another person or by themselves. We did not include people who were mentioned in depositions in a non-incriminating way (e.g., parents as part of identification of suspects; people not involved in heresy).
